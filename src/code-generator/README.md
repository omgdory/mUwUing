# For now we will translate to C++ code.

## We can write an interpreter later, which would mean we need to redesign our code-generator.
### Not that bad tbh, just gotta follow our own standards.
### We can make it in another language like Java to utilize their env. Or can turn into assembly directly.
### That is a MAJOR pipe dream btw. Assembly is badass but annoying to work with. Would be kinda fun tho...
