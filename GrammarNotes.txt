Can probably change this to a markdown file or something later on.

LL(1) methinks. Maybe.

It supports very simple branching conditions, arithmetic, and variables.

Refer to the simple program I wrote in uhhh SimpleProg1.muwu 
We can translate it from our code to C++ or something. 
TODO: Look more into that.

Convert to shrimple c++ code.

It can also output. We can add more faces for more functionality later. Shouldn't be too bad I think?

Will probably use a stack to handle arithmetic. Refer to java.
2+3 => [..., 2, 3, +] -> [..., 5]

Can use stack when we implement our own stuff and interpreter later (if we do + bytecode).

Using keywords for datatypes for now.
Support:
    Integers

Feel free to add and work on stuff as you please; imma be working intermittently.
